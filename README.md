# Static Comp 1

The pupose of this project was to recreate a static web page while adding my own content, colors, and Icons. 

## Description

This web page was written with HTML and CSS. The use of felxbox made this pages layout very simple to recreate and helped make it a lot more responsive. I added a couple of media queries so that when the browser is shrunk to different sizes, the elements on the page adjust accordingly.
